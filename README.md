# Lento

Application that helps users organize and draw out their instrument practice sessions. Motivation for building this is that I play piano myself and wanted an app to track all of my sessions for me... And so Lento was birthed.

Features:
- Integrates CoreData at every step (individual songs, sight readings, and all practice sessions). 
- Simple UI so adding sessions is snappy. 

Future add-on:
- Searching/sorting practice sessions based on songs, scales, etc. 
- Charts and summaries showing where you're spending your practice time. 
- Ways to share your progress with a friend or instructor.
